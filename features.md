## **Expression to Find the Number of Tracks Played **


```sql 
SELECT last.*, FROM_UNIXTIME(date) AS date FROM last
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);

where
     @time is the time period (week, month, year)
     @n is the number of time periods
```
- This returns the tracks that were listened to the past n week
  - <span name="#total_plays"> The number of tracks listened in the time period is the number of rows</span>
## **Expression To Find the Unique Number of Tracks **

```sql
SELECT track FROM last
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time)
GROUP BY track;
```
## **Expression To Find the Unique Number of Artists **

```sql
SELECT artist FROM last
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time)
GROUP BY artist;
```
## **Expression To Find the Unique Number of Albums **

```sql
SELECT album FROM last
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time)
GROUP BY album;
```

## **Expression to Find the Top Albums:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(track) AS plays,album FROM last
GROUP BY album 
ORDER BY plays DESC
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
```
## **Expression to Find the Top Artists:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(track) AS plays,artist FROM last
GROUP BY artist 
ORDER BY plays DESC
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
```
## **Expression to Find the Top Tracks:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(track) AS plays,track FROM last
GROUP BY track 
ORDER BY plays DESC
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
```

## **Expression to Get the Total Time Played:**

```sql
SELECT SEC_TO_TIME(SUM(duration)) AS time_played FROM last
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
```

## **Expression to Get the Total Plays:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(track) AS plays FROM last 
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
```

## **Expression to Find the Average Total Plays:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(track)/@avg AS plays FROM last 
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);

where 
    @avg is the time period (daily = 7, weekly = 54 or 4, monthly = 12)
```
## **Expression to Get New Artists Discovered**

```sql
SELECT artist FROM last 
WHERE date IN (
    SELECT min(date) FROM last 
    GROUP BY artist
) 
AND date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
```

## **Expression to Get New Album Discovered**

```sql
SELECT album FROM last 
WHERE date IN (
    SELECT min(date) FROM last 
    GROUP BY album 
)
AND date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
```

## **Expression to Get New Artists Discovered**

```sql
SELECT track FROM last 
WHERE date IN (
    SELECT min(date) FROM last 
    GROUP BY track
) 
AND date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
```

## **Expression to Get Plays by Hour**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS plays, HOUR(FROM_UNIXTIME(date)) AS hour FROM last 
WHERE date BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n) * (@time) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - (@n-1) * (@time);
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY plays
```
